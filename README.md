## State specification
The [ssvmrpc_application_state_specification.md](https://github.com/second-state/SSVMRPC/blob/master/ssvmrpc_application_state_specification.md) file provides a detailed specification for storing application state.

## Service specification
The [ssvmrpc_service_specification.md](https://github.com/second-state/SSVMRPC/blob/master/ssvmrpc_service_specification.md) file provides a detailed specification for service objects (function to call, arguments to use etc).
