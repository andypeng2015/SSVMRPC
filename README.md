# SSVMRPC
A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) implementation which facilitates both code-deployment and code-execution interactions with SecondState's stateless Virtual Machine (SSVM)

## Data specification
The [ssvmrpc_data_specification.md](https://github.com/second-state/SSVMRPC/blob/master/ssvmrpc_data_specification.md) file provides a detailed specification for data objects which will deploy and execute code (on the SSVM, over RPC).

## Architecture
The architectural design is still under design.
