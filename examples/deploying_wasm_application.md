Once you have [created your application](https://github.com/second-state/SSVMRPC/blob/master/examples/creating_wasm_application.md), you can deploy it as follows.


# Deploying your application

This hexadecimal dump of the Wasm file needs a quick tweak. We need to add a 0x to the beginning of the Wasm hex string when we deploy our application. Here is an example of how we deploy the application via Curl.

## Curl

Note the 0x, that we manually added, at the start of the bytecode!

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{
"request": {
"application": {
"storage": "file_system",
"bytecode": "0x0061736d0100000001070160027f7f017f030201000405017001010105030100100619037f01418080c0000b7f00418080c0000b7f00418080c0000b073704066d656d6f727902000a5f5f646174615f656e6403010b5f5f686561705f6261736503020f6164645f74776f5f6e756d6265727300000a09010700200120006a0b","name": "Add"}}}' \
http://13.54.168.1:8080/deploy_wasm_application
```

## Postman

Here is the equivalent JSON that you would pass in, if using a GUI HTTP client to make the POST request.
Again, note the 0x, that we manually added, at the start of the bytecode!

```
{
 "request": {
  "application": {
   "storage": "file_system",
   "bytecode": "0x0061736d0100000001070160027f7f017f030201000405017001010105030100100619037f01418080c0000b7f00418080c0000b7f00418080c0000b073704066d656d6f727902000a5f5f646174615f656e6403010b5f5f686561705f6261736503020f6164645f74776f5f6e756d6265727300000a09010700200120006a0b",
   "name": "Add"
  }
 }
}
```

# Response

```
{"response":{"application":{"name":"Add","uuid":"0xa9d57ac0f5046512"},"status":"success"}}
```

# Application successfully deployed

When the application deploys, it will return a unique identifier i.e. **0xa9d57ac0f5046512**Â . You will need to remember/save this identifier for when you are calling an application's function, in the future.

Now that you have successfully deployed your application, you can go ahead and [execute your application's public functions](https://github.com/second-state/SSVMRPC/blob/master/examples/execute_wasm_applications_function.md)
